# Mod Concept & Feature Guide: Project Cobblemon Mastery

## I. Core Vision Summary

Develop the *ultimate* Cobblemon server experience focused on two pillars: **deep, rewarding breeding mechanics** and **high-stakes competitive battling**. The overarching goal is to provide a long-term path to mastery and success, where dedicated effort in breeding translates directly into competitive viability.

## II. Core Gameplay Loops

The mod centers around interconnected systems designed to drive player engagement and retention:

1.  **Primary Loop (Breed -> Compete):**
    * **Breeding Focus:** Players invest significant time and resources into breeding Pokémon to achieve perfect or specific IVs. This is the *primary* method for obtaining competitively viable Pokémon.
    * **Competitive Payoff:** The main goal and reward for successful breeding is competing and succeeding in regular Server Tournaments.

2.  **Secondary Loop (Hunt -> Resource -> Support):**
    * **Resource Acquisition:** Players engage in "Hunts" (facilitated by Biome Warps) to gather essential resources like currency, TMs, evolution items, and potentially breeding-specific items.
    * **Supporting the Grind:** This loop directly fuels the breeding process, provides shorter-term goals, and integrates with other systems like Daily Crates.

3.  **Daily Engagement Loop (Login -> Engage -> Reward):**
    * **Incentivized Logins:** Daily systems like Login Crates and the Safari Zone encourage players to log in consistently.
    * **Short-Burst Activity:** Provides valuable rewards and exciting, time-limited activities catering to both dedicated and casual players.

## III. Key Feature Implementation Guide

This section outlines the core features needed for the mod, integrating concepts from the vision and refining based on the provided breeding guide.

**1. Enhanced Breeding System:**

* **Goal:** Implement a deep, time-intensive breeding system that is the *primary* source of high/perfect IV Pokémon. Make finding high-IV Pokémon in the wild *extremely rare*.
* **Mechanics (To Be Developed/Modified):**
    * **Core Principle:** While the provided guide outlines *base* Cobblemon mechanics (average IVs +/- RNG, total IV cap), this mod should potentially *override or enhance* these to create a "deeper" or more deterministic feel, rewarding consistent effort. Consider if the base RNG fits the "mastery" goal or if systems allowing more direct IV control/locking are needed.
    * **Time Investment:** Maintain the significant time commitment (e.g., 20 mins per egg, 10 mins hatch = 30 mins total cycle per pair) as a baseline, adjustable based on final mechanics.
    * **IV Inheritance:** Implement the core loop of averaging parent IVs but refine the modification step (increase/decrease chance/amount) to align with the mod's desired depth and progression speed.
    * **Total IV Cap:** Retain or modify the concept of a total IV cap that increases as parent quality improves, acting as a progression gate.
    * **Targeted Breeding:** Implement or ensure functionality of **Held Items** that allow players to focus breeding efforts on *specific* IVs (increasing the chance of improvement for that stat while potentially allowing others to decrease or stay). These items are crucial for strategic breeding.
    * **Pasture Requirements:** Define base building/setup requirements for efficient breeding (linking to resource investment).
* **Required Features:**
    * Custom Breeding Logic Handler (potentially overrides Cobblemon default).
    * Implementation/modification of Breeding Held Items.

* **Required Features:**
    * Teleportation logic handler.
    * Warp point management (adding, removing, permissions).
    * User interface/command for accessing warps.

**5. Daily Login & Crate System:**

* **Goal:** Encourage daily logins and provide consistent rewards. Offer desirable items through an earnable system.
* **Features:**
    * Automatic granting of 1 **Daily Login Key** per player upon first login each day.
    * Keys must be **100% earnable** through other gameplay: Awarded from Hunts, Tournaments, specific events, potentially rare drops.

## IV. Synergy & Player Experience

The interconnectedness of these systems is key. Breeding provides the Pokémon for Tournaments. Tournaments provide top-tier rewards. Hunts fuel Breeding and provide Crate Keys. Crates offer supplementary rewards and cosmetics. Daily events (Crates, Safari) ensure players have reasons to log in frequently, even if not engaging in long breeding sessions. This structure aims to cater to:

* **Dedicated Grinders:** Primarily focused on the Breed -> Compete loop, using Hunts for support.
* **Casual Players:** Can engage with Daily Crates, Safari Zone, and potentially lower-tier Hunts/Tournaments for steady progress and enjoyment.

## V. Notes on Provided Breeding Guide

* The provided "Cobblemon Breeding Guide" is an excellent *explanation* of potential mechanics, focusing on achieving specific or maxed IVs through targeted effort and parent replacement.
* **Crucially:** This guide describes *base* Cobblemon mechanics (or an assumed version). The *mod* needs to *implement* or *modify* these mechanics to match the "deep breeding" vision. The exact probabilities (15% increase, 35% decrease) and averaging might be adjusted.
* **Time Estimates:** The time estimates (44 hours for specific, 87.5 hours for maxed) are valuable *benchmarks* derived from the described mechanics. The actual time investment in the mod will depend on the *final implemented breeding mechanics*. Use these as a reference point for balancing the mod's progression speed.
* **Held Items:** The guide correctly identifies Held Items as critical for targeted breeding. Their implementation and acquisition (e.g., via Hunts, Crates, Shops) are essential mod features.
* **Total IV Cap:** The concept of a total IV cap is a good progression mechanic to include.

This guide provides a framework. Each feature requires detailed design and implementation, focusing on how they interact to create the desired cohesive and engaging player experience.
