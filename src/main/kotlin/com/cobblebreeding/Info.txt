Cobblemon Breeding: A Comprehensive Guide
Welcome to breeding in Cobblemon! This guide explains how to breed Pokémon in your pasture, how stats (IVs) and Natures are passed down, and how specific held items can influence the outcome to help you breed powerful Pokémon.
I. Getting Started: The Pasture and Compatibility
The Pasture Block: Breeding takes place within the area designated by a Pokémon Pasture Block. Pokémon tethered to this block can potentially breed.
Compatibility: For two Pokémon to breed, they generally need to:
Be of the opposite gender (Male and Female).
Belong to the same species. (Note: Egg group compatibility, like in standard Pokémon games, might be added later but currently, the check is primarily species-based).
Ditto compatibility is not covered in the current implementation.
Initiating Breeding: Simply place a compatible male and female Pokémon within the same pasture. The system will automatically detect them and initiate the breeding process after a short delay. You'll see them perform animations (walking, jumping, hearts) over time.
II. Inheritance: Passing Down Traits
When an egg is produced, it inherits traits from its parents. Here's how IVs and Natures are determined:
A. IV (Individual Value) Inheritance
IVs are hidden values (0-31) that determine a Pokémon's base stats. Higher IVs mean better stats.
Base Inheritance (No Destiny Knot):
The offspring inherits exactly three IVs directly from its parents.
Process:
The game randomly selects three different stats (e.g., HP, Defense, Speed) out of the six possible stats.
For each of these three chosen stats, the offspring randomly inherits the IV value from either the male parent (50% chance) or the female parent (50% chance). It takes the parent's exact IV value for that stat.
The remaining three stats that were not selected for inheritance will have their IVs generated completely randomly (a value between 0 and 31).
Destiny Knot:
Effect: If either the male or female parent is holding a Destiny Knot (Item ID: cobblemon:destiny_knot), the inheritance changes significantly.
The offspring now inherits exactly five IVs directly from its parents.
Process:
The game randomly selects five different stats out of the six.
For each of these five chosen stats, the offspring randomly inherits the IV value from either the male parent (50% chance) or the female parent (50% chance).
The remaining one stat that was not selected will have its IV generated completely randomly (0-31).
Note: Only one parent needs to hold the Destiny Knot. Having both hold it provides no additional benefit over just one.
B. Nature Inheritance
Nature affects how a Pokémon's stats grow (increasing one stat by 10% while decreasing another by 10%, or being neutral).
Base Inheritance (No Everstone):
If neither parent is holding an Everstone, the offspring receives a completely random Nature.
Everstone:
Effect: If a parent is holding an Everstone (Item ID: cobblemon:everstone), it guarantees Nature inheritance.
Process:
If only one parent holds an Everstone, the offspring is guaranteed to have the same Nature as that parent.
If both parents hold an Everstone, the offspring has a 50% chance of inheriting the male parent's Nature and a 50% chance of inheriting the female parent's Nature.
III. Held Items: Influencing Inheritance
Besides Destiny Knot and Everstone, Power Items directly influence IV inheritance:
Power Items: These items force the offspring to inherit a specific IV from the parent holding the item.
Power Weight (cobblemon:power_weight): Guarantees HP IV inheritance.
Power Bracer (cobblemon:power_bracer): Guarantees Attack IV inheritance.
Power Belt (cobblemon:power_belt): Guarantees Defense IV inheritance.
Power Lens (cobblemon:power_lens): Guarantees Special Attack IV inheritance.
Power Band (cobblemon:power_band): Guarantees Special Defense IV inheritance.
Power Anklet (cobblemon:power_anklet): Guarantees Speed IV inheritance.
How Power Items Interact with Inheritance:
Guaranteed Stat: The stat corresponding to the Power Item is always inherited from the parent holding it. This counts as one of the inherited IVs (one of the 3 base, or one of the 5 if Destiny Knot is also used).
Remaining Inheritance: The rest of the IVs are inherited following the standard rules:
Power Item Only: The guaranteed stat is locked. The game then randomly selects 2 other different stats to inherit randomly from either parent (from the remaining 5 available stats). The final 3 stats are random.
Power Item + Destiny Knot (on other parent): The guaranteed stat is locked. The Destiny Knot then ensures 4 other different stats are selected randomly from the remaining 5 available stats. Each of these 4 is inherited randomly from either parent. The final (6th) stat is random.
Two Different Power Items (one on each parent): The two stats corresponding to the Power Items are guaranteed from their respective parents. If a Destiny Knot is not involved, 1 other different stat is randomly selected from the remaining 4 stats and inherited randomly from a parent. The final 3 stats are random. If a Destiny Knot is involved, 3 other different stats are randomly selected from the remaining 4 stats and inherited randomly. The final (6th) stat is random.
Power Item + Everstone: These work independently. The Power Item guarantees its IV, and the Everstone guarantees its Nature.
IV. The Breeding Strategy: Achieving Perfection
The key to getting Pokémon with high IVs (ideally 31 in desired stats) and the right Nature is an iterative process:
Start: Begin with a compatible pair. Check their IVs and Natures.
Target: Decide which stats you want to maximize and which Nature you need.
Use Items:
Give an Everstone to a parent with the desired Nature to lock it in.
Give a Destiny Knot to one parent (usually the one not holding the Everstone) to increase the number of inherited IVs to 5.
Optionally, use a Power Item on a parent that has a perfect (31) IV in a stat you absolutely want to pass down, especially early on.
Breed: Let them produce eggs.
Hatch & Check: Hatch the offspring and check their IVs and Nature.
Replace & Repeat: If an offspring has:
The correct Nature (thanks to Everstone).
Better IVs in one or more stats compared to the parent of the same gender (while not losing other good IVs you've already secured).
Then, replace the parent with the superior offspring.
Continue: Keep repeating steps 4-6. With each replacement using a better offspring, the overall quality of the parents' combined IV pool increases, making it progressively more likely that future offspring will inherit multiple high IVs.
This process takes time and patience, but by strategically using held items and replacing parents with better offspring, you can gradually breed Pokémon with near-perfect or perfect IVs and the ideal Nature for competitive battling or personal satisfaction!
